# Dental-Clinic-Database

The aim of this project was to design and construct a database that can be deployed in a commercial database management system. Based on the given scenario, I created a database that could be used to aid in the smooth running of the dental clinic.
When creating this database I took into account what would make the dental practice more efficient, limit paper documents, quicker and safer access to patient records and staff management.
My objectives were as follows:
1.	To provide a systematic schedule system.
2.	To reduce the workload and errors made by staff when booking or rescheduling an appointment.
3.	To provide an efficient way of handling payments.
4.	To ensure a smooth referral process.
 I digitized patientsâ€™ records so as to make data retrieval easy and efficient. The database was developed using PHP & MySql to automate internal work flow and manage various aspects of a small clinic.
